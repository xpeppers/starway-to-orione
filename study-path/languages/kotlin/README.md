# Kotlin Study Path

1. Starts with the [Coursera's course Kotlin for Java Developers](https://www.coursera.org/learn/kotlin-for-java-developers/) (free course)
2. If you like Venkat's style, you'll like [Kotlin for Java Programmers by Venkat Subramaniam
](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EVXypZDOos) (video) - it's a pragmatic and funny introduction on the key features of the language.
3. Have fun following the nice [Kotlin Koans](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/tutorials/koans.html) to dig into the bits of the language
    * See also https://play.kotlinlang.org/koans/overview
4. Explore the rich and complete official documentation at https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/

Then, if you like Kotlin and want to go on learning and practicing, be inspired by some lectures like

* [Idiomatic Kotlin. Best Practices](https://phauer.com/2017/idiomatic-kotlin-best-practices/)
* [Best Practices for Unit Testing in Kotlin
](https://phauer.com/2018/best-practices-unit-testing-kotlin/)
* Take a look at some of Uberto's [Kotlin Pearls](https://proandroiddev.com/kotlin-pearls-multiple-inheritance-3f4d427141a5)
* [Effective Kotlin](https://medium.com/@appmattus/effective-kotlin-31215a6cf847)
* Find something interesting to read here at https://kotlin.link/
* Be curious and discover something you did't know (still) in this awesome kotlin curated list: https://github.com/KotlinBy/awesome-kotlin
* See how the design patterns could be implemented in Kotlin https://github.com/dbacinski/Design-Patterns-In-Kotlin
* [Kotlin Sequences: An Illustrated Guide
](https://typealias.com/guides/kotlin-sequences-illustrated-guide/)

Moreover, if you really want to go deeper:

* Join the [Kotlin Slack workspace](https://surveys.jetbrains.com/s3/kotlin-slack-sign-up)
* Read and follow the [Kotlin's official forum](https://discuss.kotlinlang.org/)

### Good books to learn Kotlin
